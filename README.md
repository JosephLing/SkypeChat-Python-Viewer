# SkypeChat-Python-Viewer
A simple skype chat viewer using Skype4Py to accesses the skype API.

This is primarily designed to allow people to use skype on your computer if it still remains open but is unusable. Therefore as Skype web beta doesn't allow old group chats currently to viewed or notifications this provides a way to view and message in the group chats from both versions of skype.
